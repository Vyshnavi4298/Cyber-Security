		<h1>CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING(XSS)</h1>
		<p>Cross-Site Scripting attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites.<br/> XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user.<br/> Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.</p>

       <p> An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user.<br/> The end userâ€™s browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. <br/>Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site.<br/> These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page</p>
